# Irbe4_PSU
This repository contains my bachelors work (Power Management subsystem designed for IRBE4 HUB probe) 
The repository contains full subsystems PCB KiCAD project aswell as test pcbs for the load switch and voltage stabiliser. 

Subsystems purpose is to provide stable 3.3V, 4V and 5V voltage from the input battery voltage that varies, as batteries are beeing discharged.
My subsystems design also features switchable power lines, that allow the motherboard to turn off certain loads.
